# InfinityMirror
This is several led strip patterns for use on arduino using the adafruit neopixel library.

All patterns are written to explicitly need an update call from the the main update loop. This is to allow quick switching between differnt patterns (e.g. with a button).

The original intended use for these patterns was with an "infinity mirror".
Several patterns are taken from other places on the internet, in particular the fire and boucing ball code. I've lost track of all the sources, sorry.
